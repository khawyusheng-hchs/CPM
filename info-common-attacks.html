    <h1>Common Attacks</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>DDoS Attacks</h2>
      <p>A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. DDoS attacks target websites and online services to disrupt their operations, causing downtime and financial losses.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Brute Force Attacks</h2>
      <p>Brute force attacks involve using automated tools to guess passwords and gain unauthorized access to systems. Attackers try various combinations of passwords until they find the correct one, making weak passwords particularly vulnerable.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>SQL Injections</h2>
      <p>SQL injection attacks occur when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications by inserting malicious SQL code into input fields. This can result in unauthorized access to databases, data theft, or data manipulation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Spoofing</h2>
      <p>Spoofing involves disguising communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. This can include email spoofing, where attackers send emails appearing to come from a legitimate source, or IP spoofing, where attackers send packets with a fake IP address.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rainbow Table Attacks</h2>
      <p>Rainbow table attacks use precomputed tables of hashed passwords to crack password hashes. Attackers use these tables to reverse the hashing process and obtain the original passwords, making weak and commonly used passwords particularly vulnerable.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scams</h2>
      <p>Scams are fraudulent schemes designed to deceive individuals into providing personal information, financial data, or money. Common scams include phishing emails, fake online stores, and investment schemes.</p>
    </section>

    <h1>Types of Malware</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Virus</h2>
      <p>A computer virus is a malicious software that attaches itself to legitimate programs and spreads to other programs when executed. Viruses can cause various damages, including corrupting files and stealing data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Worms</h2>
      <p>Worms are standalone malware programs that replicate themselves and spread to other computers over a network. Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach themselves to existing programs to spread.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Trojan Horse</h2>
      <p>A Trojan horse is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software. Once installed, it can provide unauthorized access to the user's system, steal data, or cause other harm.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ransomware</h2>
      <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom to restore access. It often spreads through email attachments or malicious downloads.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Spyware</h2>
      <p>Spyware is malware that secretly monitors and collects user information without their knowledge. It can track browsing habits, capture keystrokes, and steal sensitive information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adware</h2>
      <p>Adware is a type of malware that displays unwanted advertisements on the user's device. It can slow down the system and may also track user activity to deliver targeted ads.</p>
